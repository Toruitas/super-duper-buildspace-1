So, now that we've updated our contract we need to do a few things:

1. We need to deploy it again.

2. We need to update the contract address on our frontend.

3. We need to update the abi file on our frontend. 

People constantly forget to do these 3 steps when they change their contract. Don't forget lol.

Why do we need to do all this? Well, it's because smart contracts are immutable. They can't change. They're permanent. 
That means changing a contract requires a full redeploy. This will also reset all the variables since it'd be treated as a brand new contract.
 That means we'd lose all our wave data if we wanted to update the contract's code.

 1. Deploy again using npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby

2. Change contractAddress in App.js to be the new contract address we got from the step above in the terminal just like we did before the first time we deployed.

3. Get the updated abi file from artifacts like we did before and copy-paste it into Replit just like we did before. If you forgot how to do this be sure to revisit the lesson here and watch the video I made on ABI files by clicking here.
